# associative-arrays
Wenfei Lin <br \><br \>
Description: AssociativeArray.java is a program that implements an associative array data structure using an expandable array of key-value pairs. It provides the functionalities of finding values by their keys (`get`), setting the keys' values (`set`), removing the keys and their associated values (`remove`), determining if a key exists in the array (`hasKey`), and getting the size of the array (`size`) and the string form of the array (`toString`).<br \><br \>
